# C (Strings)

## üìö Introduction

My name is **Stefano Caramagno**, and I'm pleased to present this repository containing exercises on **strings** implemented in **C programming language**. <br>
These exercises were completed as part of the **Foundations of Computer Science** course during my **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering** at the **University of Catania**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **String Reversal**: Reverses the characters of a given string.
- **String Length Calculation**: Determines the length of a string without using standard library functions.
- **Character Swapping**: Swaps the first and last character of a string.
- **String Concatenation**: Combines two input strings into a single string.
- **Character Frequency Count**: Counts occurrences of a specific character within a string.
- **Upper and Lower Case Analysis**: Counts the number of uppercase letters in a string.
- **String Comparison**: Compares two strings using standard functions.
- **Substring Operations**: Demonstrates string copying and concatenation with standard functions.
- **Character Case Conversion**: Converts characters from lowercase to uppercase and vice versa.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: C for implementing imperative programming principles and algorithm development.
- **Compiler**: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for compiling and running C programs.
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code for development and debugging.  
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes and managing project versions.  
- **Repository Hosting**: GitHub for storing, sharing, and maintaining the project repository.  

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system before proceeding: 

- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**: Required required to compile and run C programs. 
  - **Linux**: Pre-installed or installable via package manager (`sudo apt install gcc`).  
  - **macOS**: Pre-installed or installable via package manager (`brew install gcc`).  
  - **Windows**: Requires MinGW.  
- **IDE**: Required to read and understand code efficiently.   
- **Git**: Used to clone the repository.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   To download the repository and navigate to its directory:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/stefanocaramagno/C_Strings.git
   cd C_Strings
   ```

2. **Choose a Directory**

   To navigate to one of the two directories containing the programs (e.g., Exercises):

   ```sh
   cd Exercises
   ```

3. **Compile the Programs**

   To compile a program inside the selected directory (e.g., exercise_01.c):

   ```sh
   gcc exercise_01.c -o exercise_01
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Run the Program**

  To execute the compiled program:

  ```sh
  ./exercise_01
  ```
