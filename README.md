# C_Strings 🖥️

Welcome to the C_Strings repository! This collection of exercises showcases my journey through the Foundations of Computer Science course during my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Catania. Here, you will find a variety of algorithms and data structures implemented in C, along with debugging techniques and project management practices.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several folders, each containing different exercises and projects. Here’s a brief overview of the structure:

```
C_Strings/
│
├── Exercise_1/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── main.c
│   └── test.c
│
├── Exercise_2/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── main.c
│   └── test.c
│
├── Algorithms/
│   ├── sorting/
│   ├── searching/
